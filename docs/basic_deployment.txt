1) create the virtual env
2) install the package
3) copy the config file (email maia.coelho.dev@gmail.com for details)
4) create the tmp and validated directories under the package directory
     (use links in order to change the default behaviour)
5) by default this hosts locally at 127.0.0.1:5000, see run.py and
      change if needed
6) if not hosting on localhost the package needs to run as sudo in
       order to use port 80 or 433

        NOTE: IMPORTANT!! this is a testing deployment,
           be sure to change the default credentials
